    "### Type Casting\n",
    "Type casting refers to the conversion of one data type into another. Here are some common examples of type casting in Python:\n",
    "- `int()` - converts a value to an integer data type\n",
    "- `float()` - converts a value to a floating-point data type\n",
    "- `str()` - converts a value to a string data type\n",
    "- `bool()` - converts a value to a boolean data type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Keep in mind that not all types can be converted to each other, and attempting to do so may result in errors. It's important to ensure that the data you're trying to convert is compatible and makes sense with the target data type before performing the conversion."
