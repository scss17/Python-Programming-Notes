    "### Functions and Methods\n",
    "Functions and methods are two important concepts in programming, so it's understandable that they might seem confusing at first. Here's a brief explanation:\n",
    "- A `function` is a block of code that performs a specific task. In Python, you define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name, input parameters (if any), and the code to be executed when the function is called. Functions can be called from anywhere in your program as long as they are in scope.\n",
    "- A `method` is a function that is associated with an object. In other words, a method is a function that \"belongs\" to a specific object and can only be called on that object. For example, if you have a string object in Python, you can use the `.upper()` method to convert all the characters in the string to uppercase. This method only works on strings because it is specific to the string data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between functions and methods is that functions are standalone pieces of code that can be called from anywhere in your program, while methods are associated with specific objects and can only be called on those objects."

    "### Functions\n",
    "A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. They let you break down tasks and allow you to reuse your code in different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of functions :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pre-defined functions**\n",
    "- **User defined functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions blocks begin `def` followed by the function `name`and parentheses `()`.\n",
    "- There are input parameters or arguments that should be placed within these parentheses.\n",
    "- You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.\n",
    "- There is a body within every function that starts with a colon (`:`) and is indented.\n",
    "- You can also place documentation before the body.\n",
    "- The statement `return` exits a function, optionally passing back a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why even use functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, you should use functions when you plan on using a block of code multiple times. The function will allow you to call the same block of code without having to write it multiple times. This in turn will allow you to create more complex Python scripts. To really understand this though, we should actually write our own functions! "

When a variable is defined outside of all functions and classes, it becomes a global variable. Global variables can be useful when you want to keep track of a value that needs to be used across multiple functions or classes. However, using too many global variables can make the code difficult to read and maintain. It's usually best to limit the use of global variables and instead pass values as arguments to functions.\n",
